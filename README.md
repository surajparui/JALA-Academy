# JALA Academy Python Assignment

The JALA Academy Python Assignment repository is a collection of Python assignments and exercises specifically designed for interview purposes. These assignments cover various Python concepts and topics to assess a candidate's knowledge and skills in Python programming.

## Assignment Files

The repository contains multiple assignment files that cover different aspects of Python programming. Each assignment is provided in the form of Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) and includes instructions, code examples, and exercises.

Here are the assignment files available in the repository:

1. **Python_Basics.ipynb**: This assignment focuses on Python basics, covering topics such as variables, data types, input/output, conditionals, and functions. (Last updated: last year)

2. **Operators.ipynb**: This assignment explores different types of operators in Python, including arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators. (Last updated: last year)

3. **Loops.ipynb**: This assignment delves into the concept of loops in Python, covering both `for` and `while` loops. It includes examples and exercises to practice loop implementation. (Last updated: last year)

4. **Arrays.ipynb**: This assignment focuses on arrays in Python, covering topics such as creating arrays, accessing array elements, array manipulation, and array operations. (Last updated: date not specified)

## Usage
